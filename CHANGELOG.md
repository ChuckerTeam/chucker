# Change Log

This file follows [Keepachangelog](https://keepachangelog.com/) format.
Please add your entries according to this format.

## Unreleased

### Added
* Decoding of request and response bodies can now be customized. In order to do this a `BodyDecoder` interface needs to be implemented and installed in the `ChuckerInterceptor` via `ChuckerInterceptor.addBinaryDecoder(decoder)` method. Decoded bodies are then displayed in the Chucker UI.
* Create dynamic shortcut when `ChuckerInterceptor` added. Users can opt out of this feature using `createShortcut(false)` in `ChuckerInterceptor.Builder`
* Brotli compression support

### Fixed

* Fixed request headers not being redacted in case of failures [#545].
* Fixed wrongful processing of one shot and duplex requests [#544].
* Fixed writing to database on the main thread [#487].

### Removed

* Removed parametrized `ChuckerInterceptor` constructor in favour of builder pattern. Constructor that accepts only `Context` is still available.
* Removed the Throwable reporting feature as well as all the @Deprecated related methods.

### Changed

* Updated OkHttp to 4.9.1

## Version 3.5.2 *(2021-07-28)*

This release is a re-deployment of 3.5.1, since 3.5.1 `aar` didn't upload properly on Maven Central.

## Version 3.5.1 *(2021-07-19)*

Note: this release wasn't properly uploaded to Maven Central, so update to a newer verion is required.

### Fixed

* Fix crash on Android 12 due to missing immutability flags in deprecated error reporting feature [#653].

## Version 3.5.0 *(2021-06-29)*

Note: this release has issue with Android 12 support, so update to 3.5.2 is highly recommended.

### Added

* Android 12 support.

### Fixed

* Fix crash on Android 12 due to missing immutability flags [#593].
* Fix not setting request body type correctly [#538].

## Version 3.4.0 *(2020-11-05)*

### Added

* `ChuckerInterceptor.Builder` for fluent creation of the interceptor. It will also help us with preserving binary compatibility in future releases of `4.x`. [#462]

### Changed

* Bumped `targetSDK` and `compileSDK` to 30 (Android 11).

### Removed

* `kotlin-android-extensions` plugin for better compatibility with Kotlin 1.4.20.

### Fixed

* Fixed memory leak in MainActivity [#465].
* Fixed `GzipSource is not closed` error reported by StrictMode [#472].
* Fixed build failure for projects with new `kotlin-parcelize` plugin [#480].

### Deprecated

* `ChuckerInterceptor` constructor is now deprecated. Unless `Context` is the only parameter that you pass into the constructor you should migrate to builder.

## Version 3.3.0 *(2020-09-30)*

This is a new minor release with multiple fixes and improvements.
After this release we are starting to work on a new major release 4.x with minSDK 21.
Bumping minSDK to 21 is required to keep up with [newer versions of OkHttp](https://medium.com/square-corner-blog/okhttp-3-13-requires-android-5-818bb78d07ce).
Versions 3.x will be supported for 6 months (till March 2021) getting bugfixes and minor improvements.

### Summary of changes

* Added a new flag `alwaysReadResponseBody` into Chucker configuration to read the whole response body even if consumer fails to consume it.
* Added port numbers as part of the URL. Numbers appear if they are different from default 80 or 443.
* Chucker now shows partially read application responses properly. Earlier in 3.2.0 such responses didn't appear in the UI.
* Transaction size is defined by actual payload size now, not by `Content-length` header.
* Added empty state UI for payloads, so no more guessing if there is some error or the payload is really empty.
* Added ability to export list of transactions.
* Added ability to save single transaction as file.
* Added ability to format URL encoded forms with button to switch between encoded/decoded URLs.
* Added generation of contrast background for image payload to distinguish Chucker UI from the image itself.
* Switched OkHttp dependency from `implementation` to `api`, since it is available in the public API.
* List items are now focusable on Android TV devices.
* Further improved test coverage.

### Deprecations

* Throwables capturing feature is officially deprecated and will be removed in next releases. More info in [#321].

### Bugfixes

* Fixed [#311] with leaking Closable resource.
* Fixed [#314] with overlapping UI on some device.
* Fixed [#367] with empty shared text when `Don't keep activities` is turned on.
* Fixed [#366] with crash when process dies.
* Fixed [#394] with failing requests when FileNotFound error happens.
* Fixed [#410] with conflicts when other apps already use generic FileProvider.
* Fixed [#422] with IOException.

### Dependency updates

* Added Fragment-ktx 1.2.5
* Added Palette-ktx 1.0.0
* Updated Kotlin to 1.4.10
* Updated Android Gradle plugin to 4.0.1
* Updated Coroutine to 1.3.9
