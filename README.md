_A fork of [Chuck](https://github.com/jgilfelt/chuck)_

Chucker simplifies the gathering of HTTP requests/responses, and Throwables. Chucker intercepts and persists all this events inside your application, and provides an UI for inspecting and sharing their content.

![Chucker HTTP transactions](assets/chucker-http.gif) ![Chucker errors](assets/chucker-error.gif)

Apps using Chucker will display a notifications showing a summary of ongoing HTTP activity and Throwables. Tapping on the notification launches the full Chucker UI. Apps can optionally suppress the notification, and launch the Chucker UI directly from within their own interface.

The main Chucker activity is launched in its own task, allowing it to be displayed alongside the host app UI using Android 7.x multi-window support.

![Multi-Window](assets/chucker-multiwindow.gif)

Chucker requires Android 4.1+ and OkHttp 3.x.

**Warning**: The data generated and stored when using this interceptor may contain sensitive information such as Authorization or Cookie headers, and the contents of request and response bodies. It is intended for use during development, and not in release builds or other production deployments.

You can redact headers that may contain sensitive information by calling `redactHeader()`.
```java
interceptor.redactHeader("Authorization");
interceptor.redactHeader("Cookie");
```

# Setup

Add the dependency in your `build.gradle` file. Add it alongside the `no-op` variant to isolate Chucker from release builds as follows:

```gradle
repositories {
    maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }
}
```

```gradle
dependencies {
  debugImplementation 'com.github.ChuckerTeam.Chucker:library:2.0.4'
  releaseImplementation 'com.github.ChuckerTeam.Chucker:library-no-op:2.0.4'
}
```

To start using Chucker, just plug it a new `ChuckerInterceptor` to your OkHttp Client Builder:

```kotlin
val client = OkHttpClient.Builder()
                .addInterceptor(ChuckerInterceptor(context))
                .build()
```

That's it! ðŸŽ‰ Chucker will now record all HTTP interactions made by your OkHttp client.

# Customize

You can customize chucker providing an instance of a `ChuckerCollector`:

```kotlin
// Create the Collector
val chuckerCollector = ChuckerCollector(
        context = this,
        // Toggles visibility of the push notification
        showNotification = true,
        // Allows to customize the retention period of collected data
        retentionManager = RetentionManager(this, RetentionManager.Period.ONE_HOUR)
)

// Create the Interceptor
val chuckerInterceptor = ChuckerInterceptor(
        context = this,
        // The previously created Collector
        collector = chuckerCollector,
        // The max body content length, after this responses will be truncated.
        maxContentLength = 250000L,
        // List of headers to obfuscate in the Chucker UI
        headersToRedact = listOf("Auth-Token"))

// You can use `onError` on the collector to report Throwables.
chuckerCollector.onError("Sample", RuntimeException("Just a triggered exception"))

// Don't forget to plug the ChuckerInterceptor inside the OkHttpClient
val client = OkHttpClient.Builder()
        .addInterceptor(chuckerInterceptor)
        .build()
```

For errors gathering you can directly use the same collector:

```java
// Collector
ChuckerCollector collector = new ChuckerCollector(this)
    .showNotification(true)
    .retentionManager(new RetentionManager(this, ChuckerCollector.Period.ONE_HOUR));

try {
    // Do something risky
} catch (IOException e) {
    collector.onError("Failed to do something risky", e);
}
```

# Snapshots

Development of Chucker happens in the [develop](https://github.com/ChuckerTeam/chucker/tree/develop) branch. You can get `SNAPSHOT` versions directly from Jitpack if needed.

```gradle
repositories {
    maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }
}
```

```gradle
dependencies {
  debugImplementation 'com.github.ChuckerTeam.Chucker:library:develop-SNAPSHOT'
  releaseImplementation 'com.github.ChuckerTeam.Chucker:library-no-op:develop-SNAPSHOT'
}
```

âš  Please note that the latest snapshot might be **unstable**. Use it at your own risk :)

If you're looking for the **latest version source code**, you can always find it on the top of the `master` branch.

# FAQ

* Why are some of my request headers missing?
* Why are retries and redirects not being captured discretely?
* Why are my encoded request/response bodies not appearing as plain text?

Please refer to [this section of the OkHttp wiki](https://github.com/square/okhttp/wiki/Interceptors#choosing-between-application-and-network-interceptors). You can choose to use Chucker as either an application or network interceptor, depending on your requirements.
