Chucker simplifies the inspection of **HTTP(S) requests/responses**, and **Throwables** fired by your Android App. Chucker works as an **OkHttp Interceptor** persisting all those events inside your application, and providing a UI for inspecting and sharing their content.

Apps using Chucker will display a **push notification** showing a summary of ongoing HTTP activity and Throwables. Tapping on the notification launches the full Chucker UI. Apps can optionally suppress the notification, and launch the Chucker UI directly from within their own interface.

## Getting Started üë£

Chucker is distributed through [Maven Central](https://search.maven.org/artifact/com.github.chuckerteam.chucker/library). To use it you need to add the following **Gradle dependency** to your `build.gradle` file of you android app module (NOT the root file).

Please note that you should add both the `library` and the the `library-no-op` variant to isolate Chucker from release builds as follows:

```groovy
dependencies {
  debugImplementation "com.github.chuckerteam.chucker:library:3.3.0"
  releaseImplementation "com.github.chuckerteam.chucker:library-no-op:3.3.0"
}
```

To start using Chucker, just plug it a new `ChuckerInterceptor` to your OkHttp Client Builder:

```kotlin
val client = OkHttpClient.Builder()
                .addInterceptor(ChuckerInterceptor(context))
                .build()
```

**That's it!** üéâ Chucker will now record all HTTP interactions made by your OkHttp client.

Historically, Chucker was distributed through JitPack. 
You can find older version of Chucker here: [![JitPack](https://jitpack.io/v/ChuckerTeam/chucker.svg)](https://jitpack.io/#ChuckerTeam/chucker).

## Features üß∞

Don't forget to check the [changelog](CHANGELOG.md) to have a look at all the changes in the latest version of Chucker.

* Compatible with **OkHTTP 4**
* **API >= 16** compatible
* Easy to integrate (just 2 gradle `implementation` lines).
* Works **out of the box**, no customization needed.
* **Empty release artifact** üßº (no traces of Chucker in your final APK).
* Support for body text search with **highlighting** üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
* Support for showing **images** in HTTP Responses üñº

### Multi-Window üö™

The main Chucker activity is launched in its own task, allowing it to be displayed alongside the host app UI using Android 7.x multi-window support.

![Multi-Window](assets/chucker-multiwindow.gif)

## Configure üé®

You can customize chucker providing an instance of a `ChuckerCollector`:

```kotlin
// Create the Collector
val chuckerCollector = ChuckerCollector(
        context = this,
        // Toggles visibility of the push notification
        showNotification = true,
        // Allows to customize the retention period of collected data
        retentionPeriod = RetentionManager.Period.ONE_HOUR
)

// Create the Interceptor
val chuckerInterceptor = ChuckerInterceptor(
        context = this,
        // The previously created Collector
        collector = chuckerCollector,
        // The max body content length in bytes, after this responses will be truncated.
        maxContentLength = 250000L,
        // List of headers to replace with ** in the Chucker UI
        headersToRedact = setOf("Auth-Token"),
        // Read the whole response body even when the client does not consume the response completely.
        // This is useful in case of parsing errors or when the response body
        // is closed before being read like in Retrofit with Void and Unit types.
        alwaysReadResponseBody = true
)

// Don't forget to plug the ChuckerInterceptor inside the OkHttpClient
val client = OkHttpClient.Builder()
        .addInterceptor(chuckerInterceptor)
        .build()
```

### Throwables (Deprected) ‚òÑÔ∏è

#### Warning: This functionality will be unavailable in 4.x release. Details in [this issue](https://github.com/ChuckerTeam/chucker/issues/321#issuecomment-626138370)

Chucker can also collect and display **Throwables** of your application. To inform Chucker that a `Throwable` was fired you need to call the `onError` method of the `ChuckerCollector` (you need to retain an instance of your collector):

```kotlin
try {
    // Do something risky
} catch (IOException exception) {
    chuckerCollector.onError("TAG", exception)
}
```

### Redact-Header üëÆ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

**Warning** The data generated and stored when using Chucker may contain sensitive information such as Authorization or Cookie headers, and the contents of request and response bodies.

It is intended for **use during development**, and not in release builds or other production deployments.

You can redact headers that contain sensitive information by calling `redactHeader(String)` on the `ChuckerInterceptor`.

```kotlin
interceptor.redactHeader("Auth-Token", "User-Session");
```

## Migrating üöó

If you're migrating **from [Chuck](https://github.com/jgilfelt/chuck) to Chucker**, please refer to this [migration guide](/docs/migrating-from-chuck.md).

If you're migrating **from Chucker v2.0 to v3.0**, please expect multiple breaking changes. You can find documentation on how to update your code on this other [migration guide](/docs/migrating-from-2.0.md).


## Snapshots üì¶

Development of Chucker happens in the [`develop`](https://github.com/ChuckerTeam/chucker/tree/develop) branch. Every push to `develop` will trigger a publishing of a `SNAPSHOT` artifact for the upcoming version. You can get those snapshots artifacts directly from Sonatype with:

```gradle
repositories {
    maven { url "https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots/" }
}
dependencies {
  debugImplementation "com.github.chuckerteam.chucker:library:3.3.1-SNAPSHOT"
  releaseImplementation "com.github.chuckerteam.chucker:library-no-op:3.3.1-SNAPSHOT"
}
```

Moreover, you can still use [JitPack](https://jitpack.io/#ChuckerTeam/chucker) as it builds every branch. So the top of `develop` is available here:

```gradle
repositories {
    maven { url "https://jitpack.io" }
}
dependencies {
  debugImplementation "com.github.chuckerteam.chucker:library:develop-SNAPSHOT"
  releaseImplementation "com.github.chuckerteam.chucker:library-no-op:develop-SNAPSHOT"
}
```


‚ö†Ô∏è Please note that the latest snapshot might be **unstable**. Use it at your own risk ‚ö†Ô∏è

If you're looking for the **latest stable version**, you can always find it on the top of the `release` branch.

## FAQ ‚ùì

* Why are some of my request headers missing?
* Why are retries and redirects not being captured discretely?
* Why are my encoded request/response bodies not appearing as plain text?

Please refer to [this section of the OkHttp documentation](https://square.github.io/okhttp/interceptors/). You can choose to use Chucker as either an application or network interceptor, depending on your requirements.

## Contributing ü§ù

We're offering support for Chucker on the [#chucker](https://kotlinlang.slack.com/archives/CRWD6370R) channel on [kotlinlang.slack.com](https://kotlinlang.slack.com/). Come and join the conversation over there.

**We're looking for contributors! Don't be shy.** üòÅ Feel free to open issues/pull requests to help us improve this project.

* When reporting a new Issue, make sure to attach **Screenshots**, **Videos** or **GIFs** of the problem you are reporting.
* When submitting a new PR, make sure tests are all green. Write new tests if necessary.

Short `TODO` List for new contributors:

- Increment the test coverage.
- [Issues marked as `Help wanted`](https://github.com/ChuckerTeam/chucker/labels/help%20wanted)

### Building üõ†

In order to start working on Chucker, you need to fork the project and open it in Android Studio/IntelliJ IDEA.

Before committing we suggest you install the pre-commit hooks with the following command:

```
./gradlew installGitHook
```

This will make sure your code is validated against KtLint and Detekt before every commit.
The command will run automatically before the `clean` task, so you should have the pre-commit hook installed by then.

Before submitting a PR please run:

```
./gradlew build
```

This will build the library and will run all the verification tasks (ktlint, detekt, lint, unit tests) locally.
This will make sure your CI checks will pass.
